A demonstration of `Dijkstra` (and if I have time, `A*`) through a simple problem:

Given a list of valid words, a starting word, and a final word, show how the starting word is transformed into the final word through a series of steps, each can be:
* Replacing a letter of a word with another letter.
* Adding a letter to the word.
* Removing a latter from the word.
